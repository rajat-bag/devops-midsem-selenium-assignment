java code for automatic testing on dummy facebook login page

I have used java and selenium for automatic testing

Dependencies to install--

1.Install selenium webdriver(I have used chrome web driver) which matches exactly the version of your browser

2.From the given link:https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/
Under Selenium Client & WebDriver Language Bindings
(download alpha) for java

3.A zip file would be downloaded which would contain:
one "libs" folder and two jar files
extract the zip into a folder

4.As mentioned above you also have to download webdriver-for chrome it is chrome driver
link:https://chromedriver.chromium.org/
Under downloads you can find driver according to your chrome version.Update or downgrade chrome version accordingly.

5.While creating java class check the box in front of public static void main String args[]
and in java build path include external jars which you have downloaded: 
client combined ,client sources,chromedriver,byte-buddy,commons-exec,guava,okhttp,okio.

6.This is all for the setup.
